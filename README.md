# PalindromeCheckerApp
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

UC11: Object-Oriented Palindrome Service
This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome using object-oriented design.
The palindrome checking logic is placed inside a separate PalindromeService class.
The main class creates an object of the service class to perform the validation.
This approach demonstrates the concept of encapsulation.
Characters of the string are compared from the start and end positions.
The comparison continues while the start index is less than the end index.
If any pair of characters does not match, the method returns false.
If all characters match, the method returns true, confirming a palindrome.
This design improves code reusability, readability, and separation of concerns.
