# PalindromeCheckerApp
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

# UC5: Stack Based Palindrome Checker
+ This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
+ It uses the Stack data structure from java.util.
+ The stack follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
+ Each character of the input string is pushed onto the stack.
+ Characters are then popped from the stack in reverse order.
+ The popped characters are compared with the original string.
+ If all characters match, the string is a palindrome.
+ If any character does not match, the string is not a palindrome.
+ This program demonstrates using a stack to reverse and validate strings.

# UC6: Queue + Stack based Palindrome Check
+ This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
+ It uses two data structures: Queue and Stack.
+ The Queue follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
+ The Stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
+ Each character of the input string is inserted into both structures.
+ Characters are removed from the front of the queue and the top of the stack.
+ The removed characters are compared for equality.
+ If all characters match, the string is identified as a palindrome.
+ This program demonstrates how FIFO and LIFO structures can be combined for symmetric validation.

# UC7: Deque Based Optimized Palindrome Checker
+ This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
+It uses the Deque (Double Ended Queue) data structure.
+ A deque allows insertion and removal from both the front and rear.
+ Each character of the input string is added to the deque.
+ Characters are compared by removing elements from both ends.
+ The methods removeFirst() and removeLast() are used for comparison.
+ If the characters from both ends match, the process continues.
+ If any pair of characters does not match, the string is not a palindrome.
+ This approach demonstrates efficient bidirectional traversal using a deque.

# UC8: Linked List Based Palindrome Checker
+ This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
+ It uses the LinkedList data structure from the Java Collections Framework.
+ A LinkedList allows efficient insertion and deletion from both ends.
+ Each character of the input string is added to the linked list.
+ Characters are compared by removing elements from the front and rear.
+ The methods removeFirst() and removeLast() are used for comparison.
+ If the characters from both ends match, the process continues.
+ If any pair of characters does not match, the string is not a palindrome.
+ This demonstrates how LinkedList supports double-ended operations for symmetric validation.

# UC9: Recursive Palindrome Checker
+ This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
+ It uses the concept of recursion to perform the validation.
+ Characters from the start and end positions are compared.
+ If the characters match, the function calls itself for the next inner pair.
+ The start index moves forward, and the end index moves backward.
+ If any pair of characters does not match, the string is not a palindrome.
+ The recursion stops when the start index becomes greater than or equal to the end index.
+ This condition confirms that all character pairs have been successfully checked.
+ This program demonstrates divide-and-conquer logic using recursive function calls.

# UC10: Normalized Palindrome Validation
+ This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome after preprocessing.
+ The input string may contain spaces, punctuation, or mixed case letters.
+ The program first normalizes the string before performing the check.
+ Normalization removes all non-alphanumeric characters.
+ The string is then converted to lowercase for consistent comparison.
+ Characters are compared from the beginning and end of the normalized string.
+ If any pair of characters does not match, the string is not a palindrome.
+ If all symmetric characters match, the string is confirmed as a palindrome.
+ This demonstrates how data preprocessing improves logical validation of strings.

# UC11: Object-Oriented Palindrome Service
+ This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome using object-oriented design.
+ The palindrome checking logic is placed inside a separate PalindromeService class.
+ The main class creates an object of the service class to perform the validation.
+ This approach demonstrates the concept of encapsulation.
+ Characters of the string are compared from the start and end positions.
+ The comparison continues while the start index is less than the end index.
+ If any pair of characters does not match, the method returns false.
+ If all characters match, the method returns true, confirming a palindrome.
+ This design improves code reusability, readability, and separation of concerns.

# UC12: Strategy Pattern for Palindrome Algorithms
+ This program demonstrates palindrome validation using the Strategy Design Pattern.
+ A common interface called PalindromeStrategy defines the contract for all algorithms.
+ Different palindrome algorithms can implement this interface.
+ In this example, a Stack-based strategy is implemented.
+ The stack uses LIFO (Last In First Out) behavior to reverse the characters.
+ Each character of the string is pushed onto the stack.
+ Characters are then compared with the original string by popping from the stack.
+ The main class selects and executes the strategy at runtime.
+ This design demonstrates algorithm interchangeability and extensible software design.

# UC13: Performance Comparison of Palindrome Algorithms
+ This program measures the execution performance of a palindrome validation algorithm.
+ It reuses the Strategy Pattern implementation from the previous use case.
+ A palindrome strategy is selected and executed at runtime.
+ The program records the start time before executing the algorithm.
+ After the palindrome check completes, the end time is recorded.
+ The total execution duration is calculated using System.nanoTime().
+ The result of the palindrome validation is displayed to the user.
The program then prints the execution time in nanoseconds.
This demonstrates the concept of basic benchmarking and performance measurement in Java.
