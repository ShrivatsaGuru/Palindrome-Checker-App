# PalindromeCheckerApp
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

UC7: Deque Based Optimized Palindrome Checker
This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome.
It uses the Deque (Double Ended Queue) data structure.
A deque allows insertion and removal from both the front and rear.
Each character of the input string is added to the deque.
Characters are compared by removing elements from both ends.
The methods removeFirst() and removeLast() are used for comparison.
If the characters from both ends match, the process continues.
If any pair of characters does not match, the string is not a palindrome.
This approach demonstrates efficient bidirectional traversal using a deque.
