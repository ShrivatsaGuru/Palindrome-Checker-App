# PalindromeCheckerApp
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

UC12: Strategy Pattern for Palindrome Algorithms
This program demonstrates palindrome validation using the Strategy Design Pattern.
A common interface called PalindromeStrategy defines the contract for all algorithms.
Different palindrome algorithms can implement this interface.
In this example, a Stack-based strategy is implemented.
The stack uses LIFO (Last In First Out) behavior to reverse the characters.
Each character of the string is pushed onto the stack.
Characters are then compared with the original string by popping from the stack.
The main class selects and executes the strategy at runtime.
This design demonstrates algorithm interchangeability and extensible software design.
